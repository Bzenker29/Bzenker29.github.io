<h1> NHL 2023-24 season predictions </h1>

<p>
    The Washington Capitals will win the Stanley Cup in the 2023-24 season. 
    The reason for this is because they have the greatest goal scorer of all time, Alex Ovechkin captaining the team. 
    The Great 8 is one of the most dominant wingers the sport has ever seen.
    Ever at his old age his production on the ice has no slowed down, this has led to many fans using the saying "Russian machine never breaks".
</p>

<p> 
    Another reason the Capitals are going to win it all is because of All-Star Tom Wilson returning from injury. 
    Last season Wilson missed most of the year after suffering an ACL tear in the playoffs the season prior.
    With Wilson returning and being back at 100% health the team is going to get a massive boost in their physicality on the ice.
    The Capitals desperately needed his grinding play style last season.
