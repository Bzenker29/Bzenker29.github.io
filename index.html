                    The purpose of this assignment was to get a better understanding of HTML. 
                    We made a basic webpage that included a few different features.

                    For this assignment we tried to format our website and add styles using css.
                    We added things such as a background image, links, and a table.

                    This assignment was an introduction to using flex to format a website.
                    We had to make multiple different columns using the feature.

                    For this assignment we had to recreate a page from the Carolina website.
